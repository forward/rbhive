= RBHive -- Ruby thrift lib for executing Hive queries

A simple library to execute Hive queries against the Hive thrift server.
Also supports PLAIN SASL connection to thrift server (HiveServer2)

== Example to fetch some results

  require 'rubygems'
  require 'rbhive'

  RBHive.connect('hive.server.address') do |connection|
    connection.fetch 'SELECT city, country FROM cities'
  end
  ➔ [{:city => "London", :country => "UK"}, {:city => "Mumbai", :country => "India"}, {:city => "New York", :country => "USA"}]

HiveServer2:

  RBHive.tcli_connect('hive.server2.address', 'hive.server2.port', 'hive.server2.connection_options_hash') do |connection|
    connection.fetch 'SELECT city, country FROM cities'
  end
  ➔ [{:city => "London", :country => "UK"}, {:city => "Mumbai", :country => "India"}, {:city => "New York", :country => "USA"}]

where connection_options_hash = { username: 'user', password: 'pass'} or an empty(nil) is accepted
It is in progress to implement LDAP/KERBEROS authentication as well. Only NONE supported currently.

== Example to execute a query 

  require 'rubygems'
  require 'rbhive'

  RBHive.connect('hive.server.address') do |connection|
    connection.execute 'DROP TABLE cities'
  end
  ➔ nil

== Example on how to create and/or drop tables

  require 'rubygems'
  require 'rbhive'

  table = TableSchema.new('person', 'List of people that owe me money') do
    column 'name', :string, 'Full name of debtor'
    column 'address', :string, 'Address of debtor'
    column 'amount', :float, 'The amount of money borrowed'

    partition 'dated', :string, 'The date money was given'
    partition 'country', :string, 'The country the person resides in'
  end

  RBHive.connect('hive.server.address') do |connection|
    connection.create_table(table)
    connection.drop_table(table)
  end  

== Example on how to modify table schema

  require 'rubygems'
  require 'rbhive'

  table = TableSchema.new('person', 'List of people that owe me money') do
    column 'name', :string, 'Full name of debtor'
    column 'address', :string, 'Address of debtor'
    column 'amount', :float, 'The amount of money borrowed'
    column 'new_amount', :float, 'The new amount this person somehow convinced me to give them'

    partition 'dated', :string, 'The date money was given'
    partition 'country', :string, 'The country the person resides in'
  end

  RBHive.connect('hive.server.address') do |connection|
    connection.replace_columns(table)
  end
